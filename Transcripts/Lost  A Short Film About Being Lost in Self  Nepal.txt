are you still have dreams ambitions now it's just expectations I feel like I'm drowning in my own thoughts everyone dressing towards something but I don't even know where I'm going anymore I'm just going through the emotions day after day I used to have ideas inspirations now it's just a blank mind working with its emptiness maybe been lost he the first step towards finding yourself maybe it's ok not to have all the answers right now maybe this is just the beginning of a new journey I may be lost but I'm not alone I have my sin and maybe that's enough for now
