empowerment is authority it is a sign permission slip to actually seize the day it's the process of getting stronger and more confident and more engaged and to be empowered is to move to the world without any kind of Fear or any kind of apology and with these gifts comes in even deeper privileged I believe and that is the ability to take charge of your own life to own yourself and claim your right and here's what I know for sure that to whom much is given much is expected and I have been given so much I've earned it I've been blessed with it but I've been given a lot and that's why I've chosen to use my life to lift other people up nobody's journey is seamless or smooth we all stumble we all have setbacks if things go wrong you hit a dead end as you will it's just life's way of saying time to change course so ask every failure this is what I do every failure every crisis every difficult time I say what is this here to teach me and as soon as you get the lesson you get to move on if you really get the lesson you pass and you don't have to repeat the class if you don't get the lesson it shows up wearing another pair of pants to give you some remedial work
