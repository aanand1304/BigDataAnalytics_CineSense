Bob the Canadian here I just wanted to talk to you today about a question you'll hear quite often in everyday English conversation and that question is what are you going to do you'll hear this question quite often after a statement is made like oh no there's no more milk in the refrigerator what are you going to do oh no I lost my dog what are you going to do now we don't say that clearly in everyday English conversation we actually take the first part of the question what are you and we shorten it down to what are you I know it sounds a little bit strange what are you becomes what are you and the second part of the question going to do becomes gonna do so you end up with a question that sounds more like this what are you going to do what are you going to do oh no there's no more milk in the fridge what are you going to do oh no I lost my dog what are you going to do and then the first part of the question also has another variation to it and that variation is what should so you'll often hear people say what you going to do oh no I've lost my cat what you going to do well that's the question what are you going to do Bob the Canadian here learn English with Bob the Canadian don't forget to subscribe thanks for watching
