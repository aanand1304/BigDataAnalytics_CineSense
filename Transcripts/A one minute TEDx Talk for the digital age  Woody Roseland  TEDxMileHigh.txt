wow what an audience but if I'm being honest I don't care what you think of my talk and get it shared and I think that's where most people get it wrong they're talking to you here instead of talking to you random person scrolling Facebook thanks for the click you see back in 2009 we all had these weird little things called attention spans I watched an 18-minute TED Talk it's been years literally years so if you're giving a TED Talk keep it quick I'm doing mine and under a minute I'm at 44 seconds right now that means we got time for one final joke why are balloons so expensive inflation
